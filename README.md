# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

My Data Analytics and Machine-Learning Projects

Credit Card Fraud Detection is a classsification problem 
In this problem there is less number of fake transactions 
so in order to have distibuted cases of both classes i.e legit=0 or Fraud=1 
we use undersampling and with the use of Logistic Regression 
which is mainly used in Binary Classification problems.
